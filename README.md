# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description

Due to the importance of what was covered during the prework I wanted a singular, easy to access, place for myself and my peers to view notes to help guide our studies leading up to class. This site will do just that, and the process has shown me how to code utilizing HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.
